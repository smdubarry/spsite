                    <p class="mb-4">* Results shown for the year 2015 represent partial period performance from July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Global Multifactor Equity Composite contains fully discretionary Global Multifactor accounts. The Global Multifactor strategy is designed to outperform the broad global equity market in the long run. The strategy seeks to maintain exposure to multiple factors which have been shown to be persistent long-term sources of return such as value, small size, momentum, low trade activity, and low volatility. Key material risks include the risks that stock prices will decline and that the composite will underperform its benchmark. For comparison purposes, the composite is measured against the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF. Stewardship Partners typically only accepts accounts initially funded with $50,000 or more. For composite purposes, the minimum account size is $1,000.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Stewardship Partners Investment Counsel, Inc., claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS&reg;) and has prepared and presented this report in compliance with the GIPS standards. Stewardship Partners Investment Counsel, Inc., has not been independently verified. GIPS&reg; is a registered trademark of CFA Institute.

                    <p class="mb-3">Results are based on fully discretionary accounts under management, including those accounts no longer with the firm. Composite policy requires the temporary removal of any portfolio incurring a client initiated significant cash inflow or outflow of at least 10% of portfolio assets unless it is the only portfolio in the composite. Composite performance is presented net of foreign withholding taxes on dividends, interest income, and capital gains. Composite returns represent investors domiciled in the United States. The composite uses foreign exchange rates provided by FT Interactive Data and Bloomberg. Returns include the effect of foreign currency exchange rates. Benchmark ETF returns are net of fees and other costs, including transaction costs. The benchmark ETF expense ratio is 0.07%. Benchmark ETF returns are based on market prices, as measured at the official US market close. Past performance is not indicative of future results.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">The U.S. Dollar is the currency used to express performance. Returns are presented gross and net of fees and include the reinvestment of all income. Gross returns are net of custody fees and trading expenses. Net returns are calculated by deducting a model management fee of 0.083%, 1/12th of the highest management fee of 1.00%, from the monthly gross composite return. This composite includes non-fee-paying accounts. The annual composite dispersion is an asset-weighted standard deviation calculated for the accounts in the composite the entire year. The three-year annualized standard deviation measures the variability of the composite gross returns and the benchmark returns over the preceding 36-month period. Policies for valuing portfolios, calculating performance, and preparing compliant presentations are available upon request. The standard investment management fee schedule is as follows: 1.00% annually. Actual investment advisory fees incurred by clients may vary. The inception date for the composite is July 1, 2015.
